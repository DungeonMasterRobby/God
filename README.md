---> means the god has been chosen and can not be selected as a parent god.
If the god name has a ( ) after it that mean that the god is split into multiple beings with each being having its own name.
When you guys get your gods made i will add them to the list. Each character is a god from the great number of multiverses. The character 
remember his past life when he wasnt a god. This past life can be from any era or time period and can impact thier personality so have 
fun. Each gods body is forged by a parent god. Each parent give a passive buff to the character. Each parent can only be chosen once so 
if you want to lay claim to a particular god claim them fast. The powers of the older gods are more powerful on purpose as they are older 
and more experienced.
